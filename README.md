## The Problem

Saudi is MENA's #1 streaming market, but Netflix trails Shahid on:  
- **Arabic content** (~4% vs ~50% local titles)  
- **Cultural moments** (no Ramadan programming)  
- **Local partnerships** (weaker telco bundles) [web:59][web:61]

## 5 Plays to Win

1. **Arabic originals** – 5–10 Saudi/GCC series/year + Ramadan tentpoles  
2. **Telco bundles** – Deeper STC/Mobily/Zain partnerships  
3. **Creator campaigns** – TikTok/YouTube launches  
4. **Localized UX** – Arabic-forward homepage + event rails  
5. **Arabic marketing** – TV/OOH/social with Saudi talent  

**Expected:** +50% subs Year 1, close Shahid gap by Year 3
